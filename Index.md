Co-thinking

- neural network. Imagine a 3x2 grid of lightbulbs. 6 lightbulbs in total, most of them off at any point in time. That's a highly reduced version of our brain, which neurons in numbers that are in the order of magnitude of the world population. Those neurons are connected in a grid that's far more complex than our 3x2, but the simplified version will do for now. Let's also say neurons 1 and 2 are sensitive: one to light, the other to sound. Neurons 5 and 6 do things to the world: one moves our body and the other produces intestinal fluids. Neurons 3 and 4 are connected to... other neurons, so we call them interneurons. Our brain is mostly interneurons.
